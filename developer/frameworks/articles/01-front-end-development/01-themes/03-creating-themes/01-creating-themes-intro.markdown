The Liferay Theme Generator generates themes, themelets, layout templates and 
more. It is just one of Liferay JS Theme Toolkit's 
[tools](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-themes-sdk/tree/master/packages). 
You must have NodeJS and Yeoman installed to install and run the Liferay Theme 
Generator. 

A couple versions of the Liferay Theme Generator are available. The version you 
must install depends on the version of @product@ you're developing on. The 
required versions are listed in the table below:

| Liferay Version | Liferay Theme Generator Version | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6.2 | 8.x.x | `npm install -g generator-liferay-theme@^8.x.x` |
| 7.0 | 8.x.x or 8.x.x | Same as above or below |
| 7.1 | 8.x.x | `npm install -g generator-liferay-theme@^8.x.x` |
| 7.2 | 9.x.x | `npm install -g generator-liferay-theme |

While you can create themes using the tools you prefer, the Liferay Theme 
Generator is designed with theme development for @product@ in mind. It's toolset 
and features help streamline theme development.
