# Understanding UI Concepts

The page's User Interface is comprised of three key areas: The Theme, which 
defines the overall look and feel for the page; the applications (sometimes 
referred to as portlets or widgets) that provide additional functionality on the 
page; and the content (the articles, images, etc.) on the page. @product@'s UI 
architecture contains these components:

- **A Powerful Markup Templating Language:** The theme's markup is written in 
  [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/), which combines standard HTML 
  markup and FreeMarker syntax, so you can use variables and [macros](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_macro.html) 
  in your themes. [@product@'s default set](https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/product-freemarker-macros) 
  gives you access to common Java objects, Java [taglibs](https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/freemarker-taglib-macros), 
  theme resources, and even applications that you can include in your theme. 
  @product@'s 
  [default set of theme templates](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-reference-guide) 
  cover different functions and features of the page, from the main markup to 
  the navigation markup, portlet markup, and custom variables you want to use. 

- **Modular Theme Extensions:** Independent pieces of code that you can swap in 
  and out or stack to create UI or add functionality. This includes small, 
  reusable pieces published to npm called [Themelets](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/creating-themelets-with-the-themes-generator), 
  permanent UI that affects every page, such as the [Product Navigation](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/understanding-the-page-layout#product-navigation-sidebars-and-panels), 
  called [Theme Contributors](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/packaging-independent-ui-resources-for-your-site), 
  and pieces of UI created in the Portal instance or CLI called [Page Fragments](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/page-fragments).

- **Configurable Theme Features:** Rather than modify theme templates directly 
  each time a change is required, an Administrator can [configure](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/page-set-look-and-feel) 
  aspects of the theme through the Portal instance. Some options are 
  configurable by default, such as the [pages](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/creating-and-managing-pages), 
  logo and site title (if displayed), and [color schemes](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/creating-color-schemes-for-your-theme). 
  The theme developer can also make portions of the theme's UI configurable 
  via [Theme Settings](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/making-configurable-theme-settings), which improves the workflow and greatly reduces the time and 
  maintenance required for the theme.

- **SASS Integration:** Themes are integrated with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), 
  so you can use variables, as well as SASS syntactic features, such as nesting, 
  in your CSS files. 

- **Global and Individual Application Styling:** You can style the app's UI 
  through its code directly if you prefer, but there are also other options 
  available to suite your needs and workflow. Administrators can 
  [modify basic styles](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/look-and-feel-configuration) 
  like the margins, padding, and background through the app's configuration 
  menu. You can give an Administrator styling options to choose from via 
  [Widget Templates](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/styling-widgets-with-widget-templates) 
  or [Application Decorators](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/theming-portlets#portlet-decorators). 
  You can customize and extend the app's navigation with the 
  [Screen Navigation Framework](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/screen-navigation-framework). 
  If you want to modify the look and feel for all applications, you can modify 
  the [portlet theme template](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/theming-portlets) 
  directly. 

- **Configurable and Customizable Templating Options:** Once you create a page, 
  layout, or site configuration that you like, you can create a template for it 
  that you can use across all your pages and sites. 

- **A Fully Featured Content Management System (CMS):** @product@'s CMS provides 
  editors and applications for creating, displaying, and collaborating on 
  content, such as web content articles, the Knowledge Base, Documents and 
  Media, blogs, the Asset Publisher, wikis, message boards and many more. See 
  the [User Guide]([User Guide](/docs/7-2/user) for more information on using 
  @product@'s CMS. 

- **Choice of Tooling:** While you can use your preference of tooling for UI 
  development, @product@'s tools are optimized to provide the best UI 
  development experience for Portal:
  
  - **Liferay JS Toolkit:** @product@'s collection of Front-End build tools that 
    you can use to [generate themes](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-generator), 
    [layout templates](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/creating-layout-templates-with-the-themes-generator), 
    and [applications](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/js-generator). 
    These tools use npm, Yeoman, and Gulp and offer first-class integration with 
    [React](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/a/developing-a-react-application), 
    [Angular](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/a/developing-an-angular-application), 
    and [Vue.js](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/a/developing-a-vue-application). 
  
  - **Clay:** [Clay](https://clayui.com/) is @product@'s web toolkit that 
    extends Bootstrap with additional components and CSS patterns that @product@ 
    requires.

## A Brief overview of Creating a Theme

Creating a theme involves these generalized steps:

1.  Generate a new theme with the [Theme Generator](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-generator).

2.  Configure the Look and Feel XML file with any additional [theme settings](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/making-configurable-theme-settings) 
    or [color schemes](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/creating-color-schemes-for-your-theme) 
    your theme requires:

    ```xml
    <look-and-feel>
      <theme id="my-theme" name="My Theme">
        <settings>
          <setting key="show-footer" />
        </settings>
        <color-scheme id="01" name="Default">
          <css-class>default</css-class>
        </color-scheme>
        <color-scheme id="02" name="Red">
          <css-class>red</css-class>
        </color-scheme>
        <portlet-decorator id="barebone">
          <portlet-decorator-css-class>portlet-barebone</portlet-decorator-css-class>
        </portlet-decorator>
      </theme>
    </look-and-feel>
    ```

3.  Update or define variables, such as the `show-footer` theme setting, in the 
    Init Custom FreeMarker template:

    ```markup
    <#assign header_css_class = "navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-dark flex-column flex-md-row bd-navbar" />
    <#assign logo_css_class = logo_css_class + " navbar-brand" />


    <#assign
    	show_footer = getterUtil.getBoolean(themeDisplay.getThemeSetting("show-footer"))
    />
    ```

4.  Modify the Portal Normal (the index) FreeMarker template to include any 
    other templates and use any variables that you need to include theme objects 
    or display UI under certain conditions. For example, the `show_footer` 
    variable shown below only displays the Footer when true:

    ```markup
    <html class="${root_css_class}">
    <head></head>
      <body class="${body_class}">
        <header class="${header_css_class}">
          <a class="${logo_css_class} href="${site_url}"><img src="${site_logo}"/></a>
          <#include "${full_templates_path}/navigation.ftl" />
        </header>
        <section>
          ${portlets}
        </section>
        <#if show_footer>
          <#include "${full_templates_path}/footer.ftl" />
        </#if>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

5.  Add any styling through `_custom.scss` and JavaScript through `main.js`. 
    Then build and deploy your theme to your app server and apply it to your 
    site page(s).
