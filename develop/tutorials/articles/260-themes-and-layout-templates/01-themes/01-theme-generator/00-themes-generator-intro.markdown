# Liferay Theme Generator [](id=themes-generator)

The Liferay Theme Generator is a command-line tool, independent of the Liferay 
Plugins SDK, that provides you with everything you need to create and manage 
themes for Liferay Portal 7.0, @product-ver@, and up. It's built with 
[Node](https://nodejs.org/) 
and 
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), 
so creating a theme is as easy as answering just a few questions. It also 
provides subgenerators that let you 
[import existing SDK themes](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/migrating-a-6-2-theme-to-liferay-7), 
[create layout templates](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-layout-templates-with-the-themes-generator), 
and 
[extend your theme with themelets](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/themelets). 
Generated themes have access to several 
[gulp tasks](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/theme-gulp-tasks) 
that you can use to further develop and manage your theme. As you can see, the 
Liferay Theme Generator is a pretty versatile tool. This section of tutorials 
shows how to  
[install](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-the-theme-generator) 
and use the Liferay Theme Generator to 
[create themes](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-themes-with-the-liferay-theme-generator).
