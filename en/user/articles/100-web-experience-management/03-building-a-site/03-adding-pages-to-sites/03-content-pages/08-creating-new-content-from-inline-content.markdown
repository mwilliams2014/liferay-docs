# Creating New Web Content from Inline Content

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can create structured web content and display it with a Web Content Display 
or an Asset Publisher, or you can create inline content on a Content Page. While 
the latter option is generally faster, you may find that you want to reuse the 
inline content you've created on another page. Rather than recreating that 
content, you can select the inline content and save it as new web content that 
you can reuse across multiple pages.

| **Note:** To edit inline content, you must have the "Edit Inline Content" 
| permission assigned to your Role. 

To create new web content from inline content, you must first select the content 
you want to include. Follow these steps:

1.  Select an inline content field, or select multiple content fields by 
    shift + clicking each content field.

2.  Select the *Map* button (![Map](../../../../../images/icon-map.png)) that 
    appears in the context dialog and click the *Create New Content* button to 
    create new content from the selected content.

3.  Enter a name for the content, select a structure, and click *Next*.

4.  Map the selected content to the appropriate structure fields and click 
    *Save* to create the new content.

The selected content is mapped to the new content you just created.

| **Note:** only structure fields of type text, textarea, html, and image are 
| currently supported for mapping new content. Also note that only one value can 
| be mapped for a repeatable structure field.
